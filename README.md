Once you have downloaded the Zip file, it should be extracted into your Arduino Libraries folder and the folder renamed to "LEDMatrix".

## Compatibility with SmartMatrix supported RGBPanels
NeoMatrix displays can be big, typically 1cm^2 per pixel, sometimes more. If you need Matrices that are both smaller and cheaper, you can use RGBPanels which are supported by SmartMatrix: https://github.com/pixelmatix/SmartMatrix

If you also install https://github.com/marcmerlin/SmartMatrix_GFX you get a compat layer that lets you run FastLED and LEDMatrix code. See https://github.com/marcmerlin/FastLED_NeoMatrix_SmartMatrix_LEDMatrix_GFX_Demos/tree/master/LEDMatrix for examples.
